# Introduction
This segment of the project replicates the work of Aziz et al. in which they used Supervised Machine Learning methods to classify a variety of microstructural defects. The numerical data was produced from the processing of metallographs of a variety of Nickel-based Superalloys using ImageJ. The defect classes were: "Crack", "Pore", "Pore with Crack" and "Lack of Fusion" defects.
